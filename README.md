### Accessibility

- I have been mindful during the coding to ensure that the website is as accessible and user friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:
- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as active for screen readers.
