#### Client Goals

- My client goals for this website are the following:
    - Increase sales for the client selling the hiking packages to an online market.
    - Enchance User Experience - Making a user friendly website were users can navigate easily and complete any purchases with ease. 
    - Build Brand Awareness - With the website, the mailchimp newsletter set up and a facebook business page, this opens up Highlands Adventures to a wide range of new market of potential customers. 
    - Customer Loyalty - Offering a online discount on orders encourages users to sign up to the site, which encourages loyalty and repeat business
    - Ensuring Security and Data Protection - Ensuring the client meets security and data protection that is needed for online transactions and hosting a secure environment. 
    - Improving the SEO Ranking - Adding robots.txt and sitemap.xml and key meta data to the website encourages a higher ranking on SEO. 

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- My goals for users visiting the website for the first time are the following:
    - The website capturing the attention of the user and that they fully understand easily what the website is about and what it offers. 
    - Easy Navigation around the website, making it easy to find the information they want. 
    - Highlight the key features of Highland Adventures, the packages, the locations, the discount available
    - Encourage them to become a memeber, with offering them exclusive discount for purchasing packages online. 
    - Encouraging the use of the social media links, where users may be able to find out more information about Highland Adventures, but crictical share Highland Adventures to friends and family which hopefully results in more visitors to the website and potential new customers and therefore more sales. 
    - Encouraging the user to read reviews of previous users experiences and encouraging more sales.

#### Returning and Frequent Visitor Goals

-  My goals for returning users are the following:
    - Encouraging users to book new packages after their first booking. With the addition of the review section, users will return to the site to fill in their review of their package and hopefully book another one! 
    - New packages would be highlighted to returning users on the home page and in the packages page. Also with the newsletter and Facebook business page, this is another method of marketing to the user if they haven't recently visited the website. 
    - Community - with the review section, users are encouraged to come back and read the reviews on the other packages and this may encourage them to make a purchase, as long as the reviews are positive!

## Features

- The website consist of 20 html pages. Below in no particular order:
    - cart.html
    - checkout_success.html
    - checkout.html
    - about_us.html
    - gallery.html
    - index.html (Home Page)
    - package_detail.html
    - package_list.html
    - add_review.html
    - delete_review.html
    - package_reviews.html
    - review_list.html
    - update_review.html
    - user_reviews.html
    - 404.html
    - base.html
    - custom_user_edit.html
    - display_user_profile.html
    - user_profile_edit.html
    - user_profile.html

    - Base.html is not accessible as a stand-alone page for the user, as it is used at the base template to host the other html pages (aside from 404.html)
    - All other pages are accessible to registered users (depending on their journey on the wesbite, i.e. will see checkout_sucess if they successfully make a purchase of a hiking package)
    - Non registered users are limited to the following pages
        - index.html (Home Page)
        - package_list.html
        - package_detail.html
        - gallery.html
        - review_view.html
    - The reasoning behind this only registered users can make purchases or add reviews on the website and therefore non registered users do not need access to these pages.

### Accessibility

- I have been mindful during the coding to ensure that the website is as accessible and user friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:
- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as active for screen readers.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

The project is deployed using Heroku. To deploy the project:

#### **Create the Live Database**

We have been using the sqlite3 database in development, however this is only available for use in development so we will need to create a new external database which can be accessed by Heroku.

1. Go to the [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) dashboard and click the create new instance button on the top right.
2. Name the plan (your project name is a good choice), select tiny turtle plan (this is the free plan) and choose the region that is closest to you then click the review button.
3. Check the details are all correct and then click create instance in the bottom right.
4. Go to the dashboard and select the database just created.
5. Copy the URL (you can click the clipboard icon to copy)

#### **Heroku app setup**

1. From the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/), click the new button in the top right corner and select create new app.
2. Give your app a name (this must be unique), select the region that is closest to you and then click the create app button bottom left.
3. Open the settings tab and create a new config var of `DATABASE_URL` and paste the database URL you copied from elephantSQL into the value (the value should not have quotation marks around it).

#### **Preparation for deployment in Codeanywhere**

1. Install dj_database_url and psycopg2 (they are both needed for connecting to the external database you've just set up):

```bash
pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
```

2. Update your requirements.txt file with the packages just installed:

```bash
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

3. In settings.py underneath import os, add `import dj_database_url`

4. Find the section for DATABASES and comment out the code. Add the following code below the commented out database block, and use the URL copied from elephantSQL for the value:

(NOTE! don't delete the original section, as this is a temporary step whilst we connect the external database. Make sure you don't push this value to GitHub - this value should not be saved to GitHub, it will be added to the Heroku config vars in a later step, this is temporary to allow us to migrate our models to the external database)

```python
DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse('paste-elephantsql-db-url-here')
}
```

5. In the terminal, run the show migrations command to confirm connection to the external database:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

6. If you have connected the database correctly you will see a list of migrations that are unchecked. You can now run migrations to migrate the models to the new database:

```bash
python3 manage.py migrate
```

7. Create a superuser for the new database. Input a username, email and password when directed.

```bash
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

8. You should now be able to go to the browser tab on the left of the page in elephantsql, click the table queries button and see the user you've just created by selecting the auth_user table.
9. We can now add an if/else statement for the databases in settings.py, so we use the development database while in development (the code we commented out) - and the external database on the live site (note the change where the db URL was is now a variable we will use in Heroku):

```python
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
else:
DATABASES = {
'default': {
'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3')
}
}
```

10. Install gunicorn which will act as our webserver and freeze this to the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip3 install gunicorn
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
```

11. Create a `Procfile` in the root directory. This tells Heroku to create a web dyno which runs gunicorn and serves our django app. Add the following to the file (making sure not to leave any blank lines underneath):

```Procfile
web: gunicorn seaside_sewing.wsgi:application
```

12. Log into the Heroku CLI in the terminal and then run the following command to disable collectstatic. This command tells Heroku not to collect static files when we deploy:

```bash
heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app heroku-app-name-here
```

13. We will also need to add the Heroku app and localhost (which will allow GitPod to still work) to ALLOWED_HOSTS = [] in settings.py:

```python
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['{heroku deployed site URL here}', 'localhost' ]
```

14. Save, add, commit and push the changes to GitHub. You can then also initialize the Heroku git remote in the terminal and push to Heroku with:

```bash
heroku git:remote -a {app name here}
git push heroku main
```

15. You should now be able to see the deployed site (without any static files as we haven't set these up yet).

16. To enable automatic deploys on Heroku, go to the deploy tab and click the connect to GitHub button in the deployment method section. Search for the projects repository and then click connect. Click enable automatic deploys at the bottom of the page.

Heroku was used to deploy the live website. The instruction to achieve this are below:

1. Log in to Heroku.
2. Find the app from this project and open - highlands
3. Click on deploy.
4. Find 'App connected to Github' and link to Github account.
5. Search for repository and link - RichBurman/highlands_project5
6. Find Manual Deploy and click Deploy Branch.
7. Click on Open App at the top right of the screen to view the live site.
